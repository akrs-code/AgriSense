## User Experience Flow

### For Buyers:
1. Add items to shopping cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Select payment method (E-wallet or COD)
4. See appropriate information based on selection
5. Confirm order with chosen payment method
6. View payment details in order history (e-wallet details for e-wallet payments)

### For Farmers:
1. Set up e-wallet details in profile settings
2. Upload QR code for easy payments
3. View orders with payment method information
4. See special instructions for e-wallet orders
5. Share payment details with buyers when needed

## Technical Implementation Details

### Payment Method Types
```typescript
type PaymentMethod = 'e-wallet' | 'cod';
```

### E-wallet Details Structure
```typescript
interface EWalletDetails {
  provider: string;
  accountNumber: string;
  accountName: string;
  qrCodeImage?: string;
}
```

### Order Integration
- Orders now include payment method information
- E-wallet orders trigger display of farmer payment details
- COD orders show appropriate delivery information

## Security and Privacy Considerations
- E-wallet details are only shown to buyers who place orders
- QR codes are securely stored and displayed
- Privacy guidelines provided to farmers
- Instructions for safe payment handling

## Future Enhancements Possible
- Integration with actual e-wallet APIs
- Payment verification system
- Automated payment confirmation
- Multiple e-wallet accounts per farmer
- Payment history tracking
- Dispute resolution for payments

All features have been tested and the application builds successfully without errors.
